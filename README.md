Instructions:
10 students wake up and go on their way to school. They wait for the guard to open the door once they get to school.
It takes them a random amount of time to get to school  But once there then they can wait to open the door.  All 10
of them must be there for the guard to open.   They will signal to him that they are there.  He will open the door,
they will enter, and then they will go to the classroom and again wait for all 10 of them to enter the classroom.
Once there a teacher will open the door and let them in to take the quiz.  Once they finish the quiz the teacher
will allow them to leave. Make sure that everybody in this scenario is accounted for, each thread has a name, and
that it either sleeps or waits.  Use a spinlock with the guard and the teacher.  Figure out a way to signal to them
as well.
